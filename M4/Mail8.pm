=head1 NAME

Sendmail::M4::Mail8 - Stop fake MX and most spammers, sendmail M4 hack file

=head1 STATUS

Version 0.2 (early Beta)
Very much a work in progress.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

SPAM consitutes the bulk of e-mail on the internet, many methods exist to fight this scurge, some better than others. However we think that this module is the simplest, quickest and most efective, relying as it does on the basic power of B<sendmail> macros for most of its methods.

As all systems have an IP address and most have some sought of domain-name, it is possible to base the protection on wether the IP ties up with whom they claim to be at the <helo> stage. You can set B<sendmail> to be picky about this. But many peoples IP address does not resolve to what they would like, its easy to setup domain to IP via people like B<network associates>, but the other way round needs a friendy ISP. 
So as this is a common problem, base the protection on the B<helo> resolving to their IP.

Next check that their domain does not contain their IP encoded somehow, people who are not real MXs tend to have numeric user addresses, this has tuning to control how strict this is.

Keep a record of whom the system has sent mail to, so that we have a chance of spotting spammers using fake bounces to fill up a users email box, at the most paranoid this refuses all bounces. That causes some problems with some systems who use fake bounces to check wether you are an MX, some even come from a completly different domain to the one being talked to at the time!??! Stupid or what?

Next check that the B<From> address is not pretending to be one of your own hosted domains, ie the IP is external and is not known to you as an outside user.

After that noraml B<sendmail> DB files will do the rest, use the B<cookbook>, all you need to know is there.

Sendmail::M4::Utils does most of the work for this module, all this does is format the B<rule>s and supply a default name for the hack. Various tuning methods exist, and of course you can add your own B<rule>s to this.


This module is non OO, and exports the methods descriped under EXPORTS.

=item 0 

not paranoid at all, has local users and is content to accept bounces and "callback verify" sudo bounces.

Standard sendmail rules and databases will handle user and bounce requests.
This just verifys that the sending host appears to be legimate.
Assuming that the hit rate on the system is not too great, use sendmail "milters" as well to take care of "spam" and "viruses"

=item 1 

slightly paranoid, has local users and is content to accept "callback verify" sudo bounces, but will refuse any bounce request that really is a bounce, that is a bounce with data.

=item 2

mildly paranoid, is a relay host with no local users, will say OK to all "callback verify" requests that refer to hosted domains, regardless of wether the user exits or not!
Refuses all real bounces.

=item 3

paranoid, is a hassled relay host, will just say OK to any "callback verify" request, regardless of wether it relays for that domain or not! Refuses all real bounces.

=item 4

fairly paranoid, is a really hasseled relay host, and has no time for any type of bounce, all refused. Most e-mail and even more bounces are bogus.

This enables the use of the additional Perl scripts to identify and block bogus e-mail hosts, especialy when the site is being bombed by an abusive system.

None of the scripts are currently available on CPAN, and there is no current intention of releasing them at this time, this is mostly due to the extra system setup required, such as interfaces to the B<iptables> firewall script bring used!

If you would like to use these, contact celmorlauren for help.

HELO DOMAIN NAME CHECKING

Most SPAMMERS use ZOMBIE PC's to send their spam, most if not all have completly numeric DNS names.

=over 4

=item *

Most have their IP address in simple dotted or dashed notation, often all 4 parts of their IP address, we will not let any who have 2 or more parts of their address as their name through.

We are considering a tuning element to vary this, maybe to just one, however a lot of real senders with several servers use the last part of the IP address in their name.

=item *

Some unhelpfull ISP's string the IP's together as a single number.

=item *

Some very unhelpfull ISP's encode the numbers in HEX.

=item *

And finally totally random strings of numbers and letters, which have led us in the past to completly block the entire domain in the standard B<access.db> file, this is often the best thing to do with hard to otherwise stop SPAMMER domains.

HELO & FROM

After intial HELO and every FROM following

This insists that the HELO host name must either be the same as the {client_name} or resolve to an address that is the same as the {client_name}.

This also handles empty FROM's which are normally bounces of some kind, or the un-helpfull B<callback verify> sudo bounce, which often originates from poorly configured e-mail systems that blindly B<bounce> back to B<Forged FROM> addresses.

{Bounce} records that a empty FROM has been recieved, these are accepted according to the value of {Paranoid}.

{Refused} and {RefusedAgain} record that the connection has been refused, only spammers will cause {RefusedAgain} to be generated, also if the B<Perl Helpers> are installed these will attempt to ammend both sendmail databases and the firewall rules.

HEADER LINES

All this does at the moment is check the B<Received> header statment, some spammers pass other tests but show themselves by pretending to send from one of our domains! Other tests are possible. But on balance we think that these should be left to a 2nd level e-mail system that can take a closer look with both B<anti virus> and something like B<SpamAssassin>, it should be noted that these systems tend to be rather slow, so should never be run on a busy front line e-mail system under constant attack.
